            Seasoned rice is cooked in a claypot with secondary ingredients, and finished with soy sauce. 
            Lightly sweet and savoury, this chicken rice is traditionally cooked with charcoal fire. 
            Typical additions include salted fish and lap cheong (sweet Chinese pork sausage) to add more flavour and depth to the dish, 
            although customers are free to pick and choose their accompaniments. As most places still use the traditional charcoal fire to cook, 
            a wait time is normally expected when indulging in this particular Malaysian Chinese dish
