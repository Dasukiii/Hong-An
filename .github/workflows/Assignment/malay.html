        <h2>Discover the Rich Flavors of Malay Food</h2>
        <p>
          Malay cuisine is the traditiona food of the ethnic Malays of Southeast Asia, residing in modern-day Malaysia.
          The main characteristic of traditional Malay cuisine is the generous use of spices. Coconut milk is also important 
          in giving Malay dishes their rich, creamy character. The other foundation is belacan (prawn paste), which is used as
          a base for sambal, a rich sauce or condiment made from belacan, chili peppers, onions and garlic.
